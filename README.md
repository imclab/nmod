It is just an experiment for me to to understand node_modules

# nmod

nmod is a simple packages installer based on
[node_modules](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.1/api/modules.html#loading_from_node_modules_Folders)
, a [0.4 new feature](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.4.0/ChangeLog#L5).
It is cloned on [ryp](https://github.com/isaacs/ryp) but is implemented in node.js.
